E-Parking App
Project Overview
The E-Parking App is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify the process of finding, booking, and managing parking spots in urban areas. Built using Flutter, Get for state management and navigation, and Firebase for backend services, this application offers a seamless user experience for both drivers and parking lot managers. The app follows the MVVM architecture to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and password recovery using OTP verification.
Location-Based Parking Spot Selection: Users can select parking spots based on their current location or a specific destination.
Real-Time Slot Availability: The app displays available and booked slots in real-time, helping users make informed decisions.
Time-Based Booking: Users can select the duration of their parking and view the corresponding charges before confirming the booking.
Vehicle Management: Users can add and manage multiple vehicles, making it easy to switch between them for different trips.
Secure Payment Integration: The app supports secure card payments for parking bookings.
Onboarding Screen: First-time users are guided through the app's features with an interactive onboarding screen.
Technical Details
Frontend: The app's frontend is developed using Flutter, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface across both Android and iOS platforms.
State Management: State management and navigation are handled using the GetX package, ensuring smooth and efficient state transitions.
Backend: Firebase is used for backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.
Architecture: The app is built following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, promoting a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
Notifications: Local notifications are implemented to remind users of their booking status and other important updates.
Implementation Highlights
User Authentication
The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure user registration and login. The OTP verification feature adds an extra layer of security for password recovery.

Real-Time Slot Availability
Using Firebase Realtime Database, the app provides up-to-date information on parking slot availability, ensuring users have accurate data for booking decisions.

Onboarding Experience
New users are greeted with an onboarding screen that highlights the app's main features, improving user engagement and understanding.

Local Notifications
Local notifications are used to keep users informed about their booking status, upcoming expirations, and other important events.

Challenges and Solutions
State Management: Managing state transitions smoothly was a challenge, but using GetX helped streamline this process.
Real-Time Updates: Ensuring real-time updates for slot availability required careful integration with Firebase Realtime Database.
User Experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface was critical, and iterative testing and feedback were used to refine the UI.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For cross-platform app development.
GetX: For state management and navigation.
Firebase: For backend services including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.
Dart: As the primary programming language.
